                "Senile comedones are a common skin concern, particularly among older adults. These non-inflammatory comedones, often found along the temples and around the eyes, appear as small bumps on the skin. Unlike typical acne, senile comedones are not red or inflamed, but they can still be bothersome due to their appearance.",

                "What Are Senile Comedones?",

                "Senile comedones are essentially clogged pores that form when dead skin cells, oil, and debris accumulate within the hair follicles. Over time, these blockages harden, leading to the development of small, firm bumps on the skin. These bumps are usually blackheads (open comedones) or whiteheads (closed comedones) and are more commonly seen in older adults due to changes in skin texture and elasticity that occur with aging.",

                "1.	Aging: As the skin ages, it produces less oil and becomes drier, which can lead to an increase in clogged pores.",

                "2.	Sun Damage: Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause thickening of the skin, making it more prone to developing comedones.",

                "3.	Decreased Skin Turnover: With age, the skin’s natural exfoliation process slows down, leading to the buildup of dead skin cells that can clog pores.",
