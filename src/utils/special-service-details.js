    ques: "The 3 Steps of Carbon Laser Peel:",
    answers: [
      "Application of Carbon Cream: The procedure begins with a thorough cleansing of the face. Once the skin is clean, a dark-colored carbon cream is applied evenly over the face. The carbon cream is then left to dry, during which it binds to dirt, oil, and other contaminants on the skin.",

      "Warming Laser: In the next step, a doctor carefully passes a laser over the face. The laser heats the carbon cream, allowing it to absorb impurities from the skin. This process prepares the skin for the final step by ensuring that all the bound contaminants are ready to be removed.",

      "Pulsed Laser: The final step involves the use of a pulsed laser to break down the carbon particles. As the laser passes over the skin, it destroys bacteria, dead skin cells, excess oil, and other impurities along with the carbon particles. The heat generated during this process also stimulates collagen and elastin production, leading to firmer, more youthful skin.",
